# RTOS---Real-Time-Operating-System

A scheduler is a software that helps schedule the processes in an operating system. It helps to keep all computer resources busy and allows multiple users to share system resources effectively.

A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system (OS) for real-time computing applications that processes data and events that have critically defined time constraints.
